Moreover, Amazon FSx provides high availability with automatic failure detection, failover, and failback. The service also fully supports the SMB Continuous Availability (CA) feature required to support SQL Server Always On FCI deployments.\nFor those of you who chose to deploy SQL AG with Enterprise Edition licenses, to avoid the complexity and cost of using FCI with shared storage, now you can use Standard Edition licenses. This will save you 50–60% in license costs. It will also simplify the overall complexity of your SQL deployment and ongoing management (like not needing to replicate system database objects across all replicas, which you must do in AG deployments).\nSee the complete blogpost here:\nSimplify Your Microsoft SQL Server High Availability Deployments Using Amazon FSx for Windows File Server | Amazon Web Services Customers have been running their Windows workloads on AWS for over a decade. Running business-critical applications often requires Microsoft SQL Server databases to be highly available. The high availability requirement demands that there are no single points of failure in the SQL Server deployment… continue reading on AWS Blog ","permalink":"https://dudutwizer.com/blogs/sql-on-fsx/","summary":"With Amazon FSx, you get fully managed shared file storage that automatically replicates the storage synchronously across two Availability Zones.
