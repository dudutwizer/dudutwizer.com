      <description>Code sample published in aws-samples/shuffle-sharding-demo-app .
In this session, you will learn how to apply the Reliability Pillar from the AWS Well-Architected Framework to your workloads. We will dive into modern architectural techniques and best practices like shuffle sharding and cell-based architecture. We will provide practical implementations with a short demo and reference architecture diagrams.</description>

      <description>cdklabs/cdk-skylight Overview CDK Skylight is a set of Level 3 constructs for the Microsoft products on AWS ecosystem (Windows OS, SQL Server, Active Directory, Windows Containers, Amazon FSx for Windows, and so on). CDK Skylight Constructs are a natural fit for Platform Teams building Platform as a Product.
Examples
Windows Worker with Domain join and Powershell API that allows running complex automation with a single line of code Managed Active Directory configured with DNS Topology and an API to create new AD Group with a domain-joined machine.</description>

      <description>aws-samples/windows-on-aws-samples Workshop link : Workshop Studio Discover and participate in AWS workshops and GameDays This workshop presents a new way to design your application using the Well-Architected Reliability Pillar. You will get exposure to implementing advanced and modern techniques like Shuffle Sharding, Horizontal Scaling for windows workloads, and infrastructure as code using the Cloud Development Kit (CDK).
In modern design techniques, Chaos Engineering taught us how to design for failure.</description>

      <title>Optimizing EC2 Workloads with Amazon CloudWatch</title>

      <description>Many customers ask for our advice on choosing the ‘best’ or the ‘right’ storage and instance configuration, but there is no one solution that fits all circumstances. This blog post covers the critical techniques to right-size your workloads. We focus on right-sizing a SQL Server as our example workload, but the techniques we will demonstrate apply equally to any Amazon EC2 instance running any operating system or workload.
We create and use an Amazon CloudWatch dashboard to highlight any limits and bottlenecks within our example instance.</description>

      <title>Running SQL Server with Amazon FSx as a shared storage</title>
      <link>https://dudutwizer.com/blogs/sql-on-fsx/</link>

      <description>With Amazon FSx, you get fully managed shared file storage that automatically replicates the storage synchronously across two Availability Zones. Moreover, Amazon FSx provides high availability with automatic failure detection, failover, and failback. The service also fully supports the SMB Continuous Availability (CA) feature required to support SQL Server Always On FCI deployments.
For those of you who chose to deploy SQL AG with Enterprise Edition licenses, to avoid the complexity and cost of using FCI with shared storage, now you can use Standard Edition licenses.</description>
